  abstract = {In the airway network of a human lung, the airway diameter gradually decreases through multiple branching. The diameter reduction ratio of the conducting airways that transport gases without gas exchange is 0.79, but this reduction ratio changes to 0.94 in acinar airways beyond transitional bronchioles. While the reduction in the conducting airways was previously rationalized on the basis of Murray's law, our understanding of the design principle behind the acinar airways has been far from clear. Here we elucidate that the change in gas transfer mode is responsible for the transition in the diameter reduction ratio. The oxygen transfer rate per unit surface area is maximized at the observed geometry of acinar airways, which suggests the minimum cost for the construction and maintenance of the acinar airways. The results revitalize and extend the framework of Murray's law over an entire human lung.},

  abstract = {Spiders use adhesive, stretchable, and translucent webs to capture their prey. However, sustaining the capturing capability of these webs can be challenging because the webs inevitably invite contamination, thus reducing its adhesion force. To overcome these challenges, spiders have developed strategies of using webs to sense prey and clean contaminants. Here, we emulate the capturing strategies of a spider with a single pair of ionic threads based on electrostatics. Our ionic spiderwebs completed consecutive missions of cleaning contamination on itself, sensing approaching targets, capturing those targets, and releasing them. The ionic spiderwebs demonstrate the importance of learning from nature and push the boundaries of soft robotics in an attempt to combine mutually complementary functions into a single unit with a simple structure.},

  abstract = {To overcome a world-wide water shortage problem, numerous desalination methods have been developed with state-of-the-art power efficiency. Here we propose a spontaneous desalting mechanism referred to as the capillarity ion concentration polarization. An ion-depletion zone is spontaneously formed near a nanoporous material by the permselective ion transportation driven by the capillarity of the material, in contrast to electrokinetic ion concentration polarization which achieves the same ion-depletion zone by an external d.c. bias. This capillarity ion concentration polarization device is shown to be capable of desalting an ambient electrolyte more than 90{\%} without any external electrical power sources. Theoretical analysis for both static and transient conditions are conducted to characterize this phenomenon. These results indicate that the capillarity ion concentration polarization system can offer unique and economical approaches for a power-free water purification system.},

@article{Ha2018,
  abstract = {We mundanely observe cellulose (kitchen) sponges swell while absorbing water. Fluid flows in deformable porous media, such as soils and hydrogels, are classically described on the basis of the theories of Darcy and poroelasticity, where the expansion of media arises due to increased pore pressure. However, the situation is qualitatively different in cellulosic porous materials like sponges because the pore expansion is driven by wetting of the surrounding cellulose walls rather than by increase of the internal pore pressure. We address a seemingly so simple but hitherto unanswered question of how fast water wicks into the swelling sponge. Our experiments uncover a power law of the wicking height versus time distinct from that for nonswelling materials. The observation using environmental scanning electron microscopy reveals the coalescence of microscale wall pores with wetting, which allows us to build a mathematical model for pore size evolution and the consequent wicking dynamics. Our study sheds light on the physics of water absorption in hygroscopically responsive multiscale porous materials, which have far more implications than everyday activities (for example, cleaning, writing, and painting) carried out with cellulosic materials (paper and sponge), including absorbent hygiene products, biomedical cell cultures, building safety, and cooking.},

  abstract = {Shaping a plant root into an ideal structure for water capture is increasingly important for sustainable agriculture in the era of global climate change. Although the current genetic engineering of crops favours deep-reaching roots, here we show that nature has apparently adopted a different strategy of shaping roots. We construct a mathematical model for optimal root length distribution by considering that plants seek maximal water uptake at the metabolic expenses of root growth. Our theory finds a logarithmic decrease of root length density with depth to be most beneficial for efficient water uptake, which is supported by biological data as well as our experiments using root-mimicking network systems. Our study provides a tool to gauge the relative performance of root networks in transgenic plants engineered to endure a water deficit. Moreover, we lay a fundamental framework for mechanical understanding and design of water-absorptive growing networks, such as medical and industrial fluid transport systems and soft robots, which grow in porous media including soils and biotissues.},

  abstract = {Mud nests built by swallows (Hirundinidae) and phoebes ( Sayornis ) are stable granular piles attached to cliffs, walls, or ceilings. Although these birds have been observed to mix saliva with incohesive mud granules, how such biopolymer solutions provide the nest with sufficient strength to support the weight of the residents as well as its own remains elusive. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of strong granular cohesion by the viscoelastic paste of bird saliva through a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental measurements in both natural and artificial nests. Our mathematical model considering the mechanics of mud nest construction allows us to explain the biological observation that all mud-nesting bird species should be lightweight.},

abstract = {Soft artificial electroreceptors inspired by electroreception mechanism of rays can locate objects in a noncontact manner. Elasmobranch fishes, such as sharks, skates, and rays, use a network of electroreceptors distributed on their skin to locate adjacent prey. The receptors can detect the electric field generated by the biomechanical activity of the prey. By comparing the intensity of the electric fields sensed by each receptor in the network, the animals can perceive the relative positions of the prey without making physical contact. Inspired by this capacity for prey localization, we developed a soft artificial electroreceptor that can detect the relative positions of nearby objects in a noncontact manner by sensing the electric fields that originate from the objects. By wearing the artificial receptor, one can immediately receive spatial information of a nearby object via auditory signals. The soft artificial electroreceptor is expected to expand the ways we can perceive space by providing a sensory modality that did not evolve naturally in human beings.}
