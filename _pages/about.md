I am generally interested in the physics of soft matter. My research has often been inspired by living organisms themselves, from the plant root to the human lungs, or architecture that they construct, from spiderweb to bird's nest. Recently, I am particularly interested in complex phenomena emerging from geometrical and topological interactions. For example, filamentous networks, such as bird's twig nest, fungal hyphae, and filamentous bacteria, exhibit emergent behaviors driven by entanglement.

I tackle these problems mainly by experiment. Table-top instrumentation and measurement with visualization is a powerful tool for soft matter research in general. Advanced image processing allows for high-throughput extraction of quantitative information from images. I combine these experimental results with computation and theory to attain fundamental principles underlying complex phenomena.
