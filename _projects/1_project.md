Mud nests built by swallows (Hirundinidae) and phoebes (*Sayornis*) are stable granular piles attached to cliffs, walls, or ceilings. Although these birds have been observed to mix saliva with incohesive mud granules, how such biopolymer solutions provide the nest with sufficient strength to support the weight of the residents as well as its own remains elusive. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of strong granular cohesion by the viscoelastic paste of bird saliva through a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental measurements in both natural and artificial nests. Our mathematical model considering the mechanics of mud nest construction allows us to explain the biological observation that all mud-nesting bird species should be lightweight.

<!-- 
The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
